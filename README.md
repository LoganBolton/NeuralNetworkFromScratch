# NeuralNetworkFromScratch

1. Data Preparation
Load dataset using pandas
Preprocess data (normalize/standardize, handle missing values, etc.)
Split data into training and test sets
2. Network Architecture
Define the structure of the neural network (number of layers, neurons per layer, activation functions)
3. Initialization
Initialize weights and biases for each layer
4. Forward Propagation
Implement the forward pass to compute the output of the network
5. Loss Function
Define the loss function (e.g., mean squared error for regression, cross-entropy for classification)
6. Backward Propagation
Compute the gradient of the loss with respect to each weight and bias (backpropagation algorithm)
7. Update Weights
Update weights and biases using gradient descent or another optimization algorithm
8. Training Loop
Implement the training loop to iterate through epochs
Calculate loss and update weights in each epoch
Optionally implement early stopping
9. Evaluation
Evaluate the trained model on the test set
Calculate performance metrics (e.g., accuracy for classification, mean squared error for regression)
10. Visualization
Plot training and validation loss over epochs using matplotlib
Optionally visualize weights, biases, and activations
11. Prediction
Implement a function to make predictions on new data
This outline covers the basic components you need to build a neural network from scratch. Let me know which part you want to start with or if you need detailed guidance on any specific step.
